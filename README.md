Hello, this repository is for 2nd assignment.

02 files have been uploaded with the name check_even_odd.py and sum_using_for_loop

1st file is for taking input from the user and display if the number is odd or even.

2nd file is for calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 50 using the for() loop.

Thank you.
